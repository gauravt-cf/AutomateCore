# 🚀 AutomateCore Scheduler

**AutomateCore Scheduler** is a lightweight and extensible scheduling library for .NET applications. It allows you to execute background tasks at configurable intervals using a simple, configuration-driven approach.

Perfect for Windows Services, background jobs, or long-running worker processes.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🛠 Simple and intuitive interface
- ⚙️ Schedule tasks using `App.config` or `Web.config`
- 🔄 Lifecycle event hooks for logging or monitoring
- 🪶 Lightweight with minimal dependencies
- 🧱 Compatible with .NET Framework 4.0 and above
- ⚡ Support for asynchronous (`async/await`) task execution

---

## 📦 Installation

Add a reference to the `AutomateCore` assembly in your .NET project.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Add Config Section in `App.config` or `Web.config`

```xml
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="schedulerSettings" type="AutomateCore.Configuration.SchedulerConfigSection, AutomateCore" requirePermission="false" />
  </configSections>

  <schedulerSettings>
    <add scheduleType="Hourly" enabled="true" hour="0" minute="0" dayOfWeek="" dayOfMonth="0" />
  </schedulerSettings>
</configuration>
```

---
## 🏁 Getting Started

Here's a minimal example to get you up and running:

```csharp
static void Main()
{
    var scheduler = new SchedulerEngine(() =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Scheduled task executed!");
    });

    scheduler.Start();
}
```

---

## 🔍 Logging Integration

You can integrate any logging framework inside the lifecycle callbacks:

```csharp
void NotifyServiceFailed(Exception ex, DateTime timestamp)
{
    Log.Error(ex, $"Task failed at {timestamp}");
}
```
---
## 🧪 Debugging / Testing
For testing purposes, you can use `ScheduleType.Immediate` to run your task immediately on app start.
```xml
<add scheduleType="Immediate" enabled="true" />
```
---
## 🗓️ Schedule Configuration Options
| Attribute     | Description                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `scheduleType` | The type of schedule to use (see supported types below).|
| `enabled`      | Set to `true` to enable this schedule                    |
| `hour`         | Hour at which the task should run (use when `scheduleType` is `Daily`)                        |
| `minute`       | Minute at which the task should run    (use when `scheduleType` is `Daily`/`Hourly`)                  |
| `dayOfWeek`    | *(Optional)* Day(s) of the week for weekly schedule      |
| `dayOfMonth`   | *(Optional)* Date of the month for monthly schedule      |

## 🧠 Supported `ScheduleType` Values

The following `ScheduleType` values are supported and can be used in the configuration:

### 🔁 Recurring Intervals

- `Immediate` — Executes as soon as the application starts.
- `EveryMinute` — Executes once every 1 minute.
- `Every2Minutes` — Executes once every 2 minutes.
- `Every5Minutes` — Executes once every 5 minutes.
- `Every10Minutes` — Executes once every 10 minutes.
- `Every15Minutes` — Executes once every 15 minutes.
- `Every30Minutes` — Executes once every 30 minutes.
- `Every2Hours` — Executes once every 2 hours.
- `Every4Hours` — Executes once every 4 hours.
- `Every6Hours` — Executes once every 6 hours.


### 📅 Time-Based Scheduling

- `Hourly` — Executes once every hour at the specified minute.
- `Daily` — Executes once a day at the specified time.
- `Weekly` — Executes once a week on the specified day and time.
- `Monthly` — Executes once a month on the specified date and time.

### 📌 Fixed Custom Schedules

- `Weekly_Monday` — Executes every Monday
- `Weekly_Friday` — Executes every Friday
- `Weekends` — Executes on Saturday and Sunday
- `TwiceDaily` — Executes twice a day (e.g., once in the morning and once in the evening)
- `Quarterly` — Executes every 3 months
- `SemiMonthly` — Executes on two fixed dates each month (e.g., 1st and 15th)
- `SemiAnnually` — Executes every 6 months (e.g., January and July)

## 🧑‍💻 Usage
### Declare a Scheduler Field
```csharp
private ISchedulerEngine _scheduler;
```
### 🧰 Initialize the Scheduler

Create and configure the scheduler by passing in your task logic along with optional lifecycle event handlers. These callbacks also provide useful context such as timestamps and error details.

```csharp
// Your main task to be executed on schedule
void RunTask()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Running scheduled task...");
}

// Lifecycle event handlers with context-aware parameters
void NotifyServiceStarted(DateTime timeStamp) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"✅ Task started at {timeStamp}");

void NotifyServiceCompleted(DateTime timeStamp) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"✅ Task completed at {timeStamp}");

void NotifyServiceSkipped(string reason, DateTime timestamp) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"⚠️ Task skipped at {timestamp} — Reason: {reason}");

void NotifyServiceFailed(Exception ex, DateTime timestamp) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"❌ Task failed at {timestamp} — Error: {ex.Message}");

// Initialize the scheduler with task and callbacks
_scheduler = new SchedulerEngine(
    RunTask,
    onTaskStarted: NotifyServiceStarted,
    onTaskCompleted: NotifyServiceCompleted,
    onTaskSkipped: NotifyServiceSkipped,
    onTaskFailed: NotifyServiceFailed
);
```
 ---
 ## 🚀 Scheduler Control Easily control the scheduler's lifecycle using the following methods:
 ### ▶️ Start the Scheduler 
 ```csharp 
 _scheduler.Start();
 ``` 
 > Use this when your task delegates are **not async**. 
 > If your tasks are async or use `await`, call the async version instead:

 #### ✅ Start Async (for async tasks) 

 ```csharp
 await _scheduler.StartAsync();
 ``` 

 ---
 ### ⏹️ Stop the Scheduler Gracefully stops the scheduler and waits for any running tasks to complete.
 ```csharp 
 _scheduler.Stop();
 ``` 
 --- 
 ### ⏸️ Pause the Scheduler Temporarily pauses all scheduled tasks without clearing them. You can resume later.
 ```csharp 
 _scheduler.Pause();
 ``` 
 --- 
 ### ▶️ Resume the Scheduler Resumes task execution after a pause. 
 ```csharp 
 _scheduler.Resume();
 ```
 --- 
## 🪝 Lifecycle Hooks

You can pass in optional delegates to handle different lifecycle events of the scheduled task:

- **`onTaskStarted`** — Called before the task starts.
- **`onTaskCompleted`** — Called after the task completes successfully.
- **`onTaskSkipped`** — Called if the task is skipped based on the schedule.
- **`onTaskFailed`** — Called if the task throws an exception.

---
## 📘 Example
```csharp
void RunTask()
{
    // Your background logic here
}

void NotifyServiceStarted(DateTime timeStamp) => Console.WriteLine("Task started");
void NotifyServiceCompleted(DateTime timeStamp) => Console.WriteLine("Task completed");
void NotifyServiceSkipped(string reason, DateTime timestamp) => Console.WriteLine("Task skipped");
void NotifyServiceFailed(Exception ex, DateTime timestamp) => Console.WriteLine($"Task failed: {ex.Message}");
```

---

## 🧩 Extensibility

AutomateCore Scheduler is designed to be easily extensible.

You can create your own custom schedule types by implementing the `IScheduleCalculator` interface. This allows you to define completely custom logic for determining the next run time of your task.

### Example:

```csharp
public class CustomScheduleCalculator : IScheduleCalculator
{
    public DateTime GetNextRunTime(DateTime lastRun)
    {
        // Custom logic to calculate next run time
        return lastRun.AddMinutes(7); // for example, every 7 minutes
    }
}
```
